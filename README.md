# ML-PRACTICA-1
Class project corresponding to the Machine Learning part of our subject Artificial Intelligence (21722) The goal of the project is to introduce us into the world of ML

Given two wine datasets with multiple features we had to perform a series of steps to develop a model that could determine it's quality. The steps that we've taken are the following:
- Preprocess and visualize the data
- Building the models. We were indicated to use a Logistic Regression, a Perceptron and a Random Forest
- Feature engineering for each model
- We perform a Grid Search to the best performing models

This project gave us an opportunity to introduce ourselves in to the field of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, and also to learn how to use the Sci-kit Learn library.
